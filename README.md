## About me

👋 Hi, I'm Nico—a passionate software web developer with a deep love for both frontend and backend development. I thrive on crafting nice user experiences through intuitive interfaces and robust, efficient server-side solutions. I am a final year software engineering student also captivated by software architecture, it is essential to look for elegant and scalable designs to address complex problems.

💬 I firmly believe that great software is not just functional; it's a manifestation of creativity combined with technical precision. When I'm not coding or designing software systems, you'll likely find me exploring new technologies or reading about the latest industry trends.

🔭 My intention is to work in a company that has interesting projects and allows personal growth, with people who value details and who like to develop products where quality, good practices and the use of modern tools on a day-to-day basis are important.

⚡ I'm good with challenges, I never give up!
